# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Data-Analysis

I’m excited to share my latest project where I used Power BI to analyze and visualize Air Quality Index (AQI) data for Indian cities. With the growing challenges of air pollution, monitoring AQI is crucial to understanding its impact on public health.

🔍 Project Overview: This project includes dynamic dashboards that showcase air quality trends over time, by location, and pollutant type. Key insights involve identifying cities with the highest and lowest pollution levels, analyzing AQI trends, and highlighting average levels of pollutants like PM2.5, NO, and SO2.

🔗 Data Source:
▪️ Historical AQI data from various cities and timeframes.
▪️ Visualizations: Interactive dashboards to explore air quality trends by time, location, and pollutant types.

✨ Key Insights:
▪️ Identified cities with the highest and lowest pollution levels.
▪️ Analyzed AQI trends by time and location.
▪️ Highlighted average levels of pollutants like PM2.5, NO, and SO2 by location.

⚙️ Features:
▪️ Drill-down options for detailed analysis by city, pollutant, or year.
▪️ Interactive filters for exploring specific locations and time periods in greater detail.

🌱 Outcome: This project can be a valuable tool for policy-makers, environmentalists, and the public to make data-driven decisions for improving air quality.
